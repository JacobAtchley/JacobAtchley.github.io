         Hello, my name is Jacob. I created this site to play around with different web technologies.
         I have a strong background is dotnet including C#, ASP.net, MVC, ASP.net Core, Azure and Sql Server.
         I've made use of jQuery, Knockout, and Vue JavaScript libraries on the client side. I am a failed but improving CSS developer.
         When I'm not coding I like to spend time with my family, play bass, visit with friends, and nerd out on comic books. Have a look around and feel free to contact me on via the links below in the footer.  
    </p>
